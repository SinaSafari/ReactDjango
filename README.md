# React Django simple app
> serve react as aapp in django project

use babel to load ```.js``` files and serve them as static template. for simplicity I use bootstrap and loading external ```.css``` files is NOT implemented yet.

for activate the virtual environment:
```
pipenv shell
```

for installing packages in django using pipenv:
```
pipenv install 
```

for frontend and react installation:

``` 
npm install
```

for running django server:
``` 
cd project && python manage.py runserver
```

for running frontend react app:
``` 
npm run dev
```
